# Todo List On Steroids

![Build badge](https://github.com/ElCholoGamer/todo-list-on-steroids/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

I swear I totally regret not using TypeScript from the start lmfao

Well I guess I should leave a usage guide or something

## Usage

<br />

Clone the repo and select directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ElCholoGamer/todo-list-on-steroids.git
$ cd todo-list-on-steroids
```

Install dependencies (yarn) and build:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

Add the MongoDB connection URI to a `.env` file:

```
ATLAS_URI="some-mongodb-uri"
SESSION_SECRET="something-idk"
```

Finally, serve build files and stuff:

```
$ yarn serve
```
