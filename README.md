# Todo List On Steroids

I swear I totally regret not using TypeScript lmfao

Well I guess I should leave a usage guide or something

## Usage

<br />

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ElCholoGamer/todo-list-on-steroids.git
```

Install dependencies (yarn) and build:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

Add the mongoDB connection URI to a `.env` file:

```
ATLAS_URI="some-mongodb-uri"
```

Finally, serve build files and stuff:

```
$ yarn serve
```
